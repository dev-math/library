          The library
        </h2>
        <p class="text-padding">
          A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are
          accessible for use and not just for display purposes. A library
          provides physical (hard copies) or digital RR (soft copies)
          materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or
          both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other
          physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette as
          well as access to information, music or other content held on
          bibliographic databases.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding">
          A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use
          and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution
          such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual.
          In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the
          services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding,
          selecting, circulating and organizing information and at
          interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large
          amounts of information with a variety of resources.
        </p>
        <p class="text-padding">
          Library buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as
          common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide
          public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for
          instance: computers and access to the Internet. The library's
          clientele and services offered vary depending on its type: users of
          a public library have different needs from those of a special
          library or academic library, for example. Libraries may also be
          community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in
          lifelong learning. Modern libraries extend their services beyond the
          physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by
          electronic means, including from home via the Internet.
